<ul>
<li>Chakra is expected to be used for IoT and cloud services</li>
<li>Intel, AMD and NodeSource(!!) will work with M$</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="history-of-chakra">History of Chakra</h3>
<ul>
<li>Started in 2008</li>
<li>Interpreter + Multi-tiered background JIT compiler + mark-and-sweep GC(concurrent &amp; partial collections)</li>
<li>Ability to throttle resource consumption to execute code within constrained resource environments</li>
<li>Powers Win10 UWA, Azure DocumentDB, Cortana, Outlook.com(probably in the same way that V8 powers Gmail=.=)</li>
<li>Optimized for TypeScript(hmmm...bingo)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="difference-between-chakracore-and-chakra">Difference between ChakraCore and Chakra</h4>
<ul>
<li>ChakraCore doesn&#39;t have the private bindings to UWP and the browser</li>
<li>ChakraCore has a new platform-agnostic diagnostics API(hmm...interesting), while Chakra only has another old COM-based diagnostics API</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="what-s-next">What&#39;s next</h4>
<ul>
<li>Their vision is REALLY BIG: small-footprint IoT app, high-throughput cloud-based massively parallel servers...</li>
<li>Fast, scalable, lightweight, and most improtantly, <strong>cross-platform</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I think the main reason that they haven&#39;t open sourced Chakra until now is its coupling with the browser -- they must have a lot of cleaning to do to make it appropriate to be open sourced. I doubt if M$ would ever open source the whole browser though...after all it&#39;s a part of the Windows OS, so there can be security risks.</p>
<p>M$ is much, much more open these days...now they have</p>
<ul>
<li>An open-sourced JS engine, with the widest support for ES2015/2016 features(yeah, I&#39;m looking at you, V8, Babel), SIMD.js, asm.js, and has impressive performance(good scores on Octane2.0 and Jet Stream)</li>
<li>An open-sourced compile-to-js language TypeScript, with a considerably good community, and great tooling(and IMHO Anders Hejlsberg is a genius, so is his concept of optional typing)</li>
<li>An open-sourced cross-platform text editor Visual Studio Code with first-class support for JavaScript(debugging, etc.)</li>
<li>Platinum membership in the Node.js foundation</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to Google, they certainly have invested much more on the JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>There has been a discussion about building a abstraction layer over JS engines in the Node.js community, but there wasn&#39;t any strong argument apart from making it easier to keep up with the ABI changes of V8. By then the alternative JS engine that could be in the game is SpiderMonkey, and that wasn&#39;t a particularly good choice since the development resource of Mozilla is also limited, and they don&#39;t really care about server market either. Who would&#39;ve thought it will be Chakra that changes the situation? Unlike V8, Chakra does care about the server market(cloud-based), the enterprise market, and even the IoT market(V8, however, doesn&#39;t really have these in mind, it&#39;s designed for browsers running on machines with not-that-limited resource, powering web pages that most likely won&#39;t last for more than a day). Not to mention that M$ have the money, the resource, and a platinum membership in the Node.js foundation. I think this move can really change the game.</p>
